# Stock-Price-Predictor
Predicting the stock price using LSTM

All the code is present in Stock Price Predictor. A model can be implemented/trained easily by using these commands.

Steps used :

Prepare the data

Feature Scaling (Preprocessing of data)

Split the dataset for train and test

Converting features into NumPy array and reshaping the array into shape accepted by LSTM model

Build the architecture for LSTM network

Compile and fit the model (Training)

Evaluate the performance of model(Test)
